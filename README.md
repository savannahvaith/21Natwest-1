## Exceptions 

An exception is an abnormal condition; in Java it is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
An object is thrown at runtime for this, the object is contextual to the type of exception.
Every system is going to have exceptions that occur at some point, exception handling is the way in which we prevent the system from terminating unexpectedly and it is all about handling the errors in a desirable way.
Exceptions are not errors, they are different things.
